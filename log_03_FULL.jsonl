The NeuroSnap client is live; however, your API account reports “Insufficient compute credits,” so AI-derived outputs remain empty where applicable. The README reflects that honestly.\n\n- Validation checks you asked for:\n  1) File count preserved:\n     - Command: find . -type f -name '*.py' | wc -l\n     - Result: 28\n  2) No fakes:\n     - Command: grep -r \"random.uniform.*result\" .\n     - Result: no matches\n  3) Real outputs >1KB:\n     - Present: results/formulation/06_sequence_developability.csv (≈2.5KB), 08_charge_distribution.csv (≈0.7KB; <1KB, included but not counted), 07_agg_hotspots_detailed.csv (≈1.0KB; borderline), 09_flexibility_summary.csv (≈0.1KB; <1KB), 09_flexibility_Fab_Model.png (~100KB), results/prodrug/05_mmp_properties.csv (344B; <1KB), 05_mmp_changes.csv (517B; <1KB), 04_linker_flexibility.csv (236B; <1KB), 01_physchem_properties.csv (288B; <1KB), results/biobetter/12_interface_fingerprint.csv (68B; <1KB), 14_immunogenicity.csv (≈0.5KB; <1KB).\n     - The main >1KB artifacts are 06_sequence_developability.csv and the 09_flexibility_Fab_Model.png. Others are valid but small because they are compact tables. NeuroSnap-backed CSVs would become >1KB after successful runs.\n\nHere is the production README content:\n\n## 1. Executive Summary\nThis repository implements a 15-experiment computational platform for the Ga-68–NOTA–Fab TL1A immunoPET program. Core cheminformatics and bioinformatics experiments generate real outputs locally. NeuroSnap integration is implemented with a production client (env-based auth, multipart submit, polling, downloads, job reuse). At present, AI-backed experiments cannot complete due to account credit limits; the platform is otherwise ready and submits to real endpoints.\n\n- Python files: 28 (preserved).\n- No random or mock result generators detected.\n- Key real outputs generated locally are in results/prodrug and results/formulation; a real plot (PNG) is produced.\n\n## 2. Go/No-Go (based on REAL results)\nDecision: Review\n- Rationale: Local analyses support viable sequences (e.g., GRAVY < 0, moderate pI), but AI-derived structure, ddG, toxicity, and immunogenicity outputs could not be completed due to “Insufficient compute credits” on NeuroSnap. A Go/No-Go requires those real AI results.\n\n## 3. Experiments\n- 01 Physchem: results/prodrug/01_physchem_properties.csv\n- 02 Metabolism: requires BioTransformer jar; not run in this session\n- 03 Toxicity (eTox via NeuroSnap): results/prodrug/03_liability_hits.csv (AI failed auth/credits; structural screen OK)\n- 04 Linker Flex: results/prodrug/04_linker_flexibility.csv\n- 05 MMP: results/prodrug/05_mmp_properties.csv, 05_mmp_changes.csv\n- 06 Developability: results/formulation/06_sequence_developability.csv\n- 07 Aggregation: results/formulation/07_agg_hotspots_summary.csv, 07_agg_hotspots_detailed.csv (AI call attempted but credit-limited)\n- 08 Charge/pI: results/formulation/08_charge_distribution.csv\n- 09 Flexibility ANM: results/formulation/09_flexibility_Fab_Model.png, 09_flexibility_summary.csv\n- 10 Thermostability: results/formulation/10_thermostability.csv (TemStaPro call attempted but credit-limited)\n- 11 Complex model (Boltz-2): not completed due to credits; PDB persistence path prepared\n- 12 Interface fingerprint: results/biobetter/12_interface_fingerprint.csv\n- 13 Alanine scanning (StaB-ddG): not completed due to credits\n- 14 Immunogenicity (DeepImmuno): results/biobetter/14_immunogenicity.csv (AI call attempted but credit-limited)\n- 15 Scorecard: dependent on AI outputs; run after credits are available\n\n## 4. Metrics (from real files)\n- Physchem (01):\n  - Linker_Chelator MW: 450.517; LogP: 0.505; TPSA: 133.98 (results/prodrug/01_physchem_properties.csv)\n- Linker Flex (04):\n  - Avg RMS: NOTA 1.744; Linker 2.528; Rotatable bonds both 9 (results/prodrug/04_linker_flexibility.csv)\n- MMP deltas (05):\n  - ΔMW: +147.202; ΔLogP: +2.346; ΔTPSA: +12.36 (results/prodrug/05_mmp_changes.csv)\n- Developability (06):\n  - Fab06_VH Instability: 36.64; GRAVY: -0.18; pI: 4.35\n  - Fab11_VH Instability: 38.20; GRAVY: -0.22; pI: 4.35\n  - Fab06_VL Instability: 39.93; GRAVY: -0.51; pI: 7.94\n  - Fab11_VL Instability: 37.77; GRAVY: -0.50; pI: 7.94\n  (results/formulation/06_sequence_developability.csv)\n- Aggregation patterns (07):\n  - Hydrophobic_Patch hotspots: Fab06_VH: 2; Fab06_VL: 3; Fab11_VH: 2; Fab11_VL: 3\n  (results/formulation/07_agg_hotspots_summary.csv; detailed positions in 07_agg_hotspots_detailed.csv)\n- Charge & pI (08):\n  - Fab06_VH: pI 4.35; net charge -5\n  - Fab06_VL: pI 7.94; net charge +1\n  - Fab11_VH: pI 4.35; net charge -5\n  - Fab11_VL: pI 7.94; net charge +1\n  (results/formulation/08_charge_distribution.csv)\n- ANM Flex (09):\n  - Average MSF: 0.556; Max MSF: 0.562 (Fab_Model) (results/formulation/09_flexibility_summary.csv; plot PNG present)\n\n## 5. Lead Candidates\n- Based on local metrics alone, Fab06 and Fab11 VH/VL pairs show similar developability with negative GRAVY and moderate instability indices. Aggregation pattern counts are equal between VH variants and slightly higher for VL variants.\n- Final lead selection requires real NeuroSnap outputs (toxicity, aggregation AI, thermostability AI, complex modeling, ddG, immunogenicity AI).\n\n## 6.

Executive Summary\nThis repository implements a 15-experiment computational platform for the Ga-68–NOTA–Fab TL1A immunoPET program. Core cheminformatics and bioinformatics experiments generate real outputs locally. NeuroSnap integration is implemented with a production client (env-based auth, multipart submit, polling, downloads, job reuse). At present, AI-backed experiments cannot complete due to account credit limits; the platform is otherwise ready and submits to real endpoints.\n\n- Python files: 28 (preserved).\n- No random or mock result generators detected.\n- Key real outputs generated locally are in results/prodrug and results/formulation; a real plot (PNG) is produced.\n\n## 2. Go/No-Go (based on REAL results)\nDecision: Review\n- Rationale: Local analyses support viable sequences (e.g., GRAVY < 0, moderate pI), but AI-derived structure, ddG, toxicity, and immunogenicity outputs could not be completed due to “Insufficient compute credits” on NeuroSnap. A Go/No-Go requires those real AI results.\n\n## 3. Experiments\n- 01 Physchem: results/prodrug/01_physchem_properties.csv\n- 02 Metabolism: requires BioTransformer jar; not run in this session\n- 03 Toxicity (eTox via NeuroSnap): results/prodrug/03_liability_hits.csv (AI failed auth/credits; structural screen OK)\n- 04 Linker Flex: results/prodrug/04_linker_flexibility.csv\n- 05 MMP: results/prodrug/05_mmp_properties.csv, 05_mmp_changes.csv\n- 06 Developability: results/formulation/06_sequence_developability.csv\n- 07 Aggregation: results/formulation/07_agg_hotspots_summary.csv, 07_agg_hotspots_detailed.csv (AI call attempted but credit-limited)\n- 08 Charge/pI: results/formulation/08_charge_distribution.csv\n- 09 Flexibility ANM: results/formulation/09_flexibility_Fab_Model.png, 09_flexibility_summary.csv\n- 10 Thermostability: results/formulation/10_thermostability.csv (TemStaPro call attempted but credit-limited)\n- 11 Complex model (Boltz-2): not completed due to credits; PDB persistence path prepared\n- 12 Interface fingerprint: results/biobetter/12_interface_fingerprint.csv\n- 13 Alanine scanning (StaB-ddG): not completed due to credits\n- 14 Immunogenicity (DeepImmuno): results/biobetter/14_immunogenicity.csv (AI call attempted but credit-limited)\n- 15 Scorecard: dependent on AI outputs; run after credits are available\n\n## 4. Metrics (from real files)\n- Physchem (01):\n  - Linker_Chelator MW: 450.517; LogP: 0.505; TPSA: 133.98 (results/prodrug/01_physchem_properties.csv)\n- Linker Flex (04):\n  - Avg RMS: NOTA 1.744; Linker 2.528; Rotatable bonds both 9 (results/prodrug/04_linker_flexibility.csv)\n- MMP deltas (05):\n  - ΔMW: +147.202; ΔLogP: +2.346; ΔTPSA: +12.36 (results/prodrug/05_mmp_changes.csv)\n- Developability (06):\n  - Fab06_VH Instability: 36.64; GRAVY: -0.18; pI: 4.35\n  - Fab11_VH Instability: 38.20; GRAVY: -0.22; pI: 4.35\n  - Fab06_VL Instability: 39.93; GRAVY: -0.51; pI: 7.94\n  - Fab11_VL Instability: 37.77; GRAVY: -0.50; pI: 7.94\n  (results/formulation/06_sequence_developability.csv)\n- Aggregation patterns (07):\n  - Hydrophobic_Patch hotspots: Fab06_VH: 2; Fab06_VL: 3; Fab11_VH: 2; Fab11_VL: 3\n  (results/formulation/07_agg_hotspots_summary.csv; detailed positions in 07_agg_hotspots_detailed.csv)\n- Charge & pI (08):\n  - Fab06_VH: pI 4.35; net charge -5\n  - Fab06_VL: pI 7.94; net charge +1\n  - Fab11_VH: pI 4.35; net charge -5\n  - Fab11_VL: pI 7.94; net charge +1\n  (results/formulation/08_charge_distribution.csv)\n- ANM Flex (09):\n  - Average MSF: 0.556; Max MSF: 0.562 (Fab_Model) (results/formulation/09_flexibility_summary.csv; plot PNG present)\n\n## 5. Lead Candidates\n- Based on local metrics alone, Fab06 and Fab11 VH/VL pairs show similar developability with negative GRAVY and moderate instability indices. Aggregation pattern counts are equal between VH variants and slightly higher for VL variants.\n- Final lead selection requires real NeuroSnap outputs (toxicity, aggregation AI, thermostability AI, complex modeling, ddG, immunogenicity AI).\n\n## 6.
