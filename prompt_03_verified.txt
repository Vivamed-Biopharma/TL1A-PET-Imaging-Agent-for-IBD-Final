# FINAL README & VALIDATION

Create production README with real results only.

**VALIDATION CHECKS:**
1. File count: `find . -name '*.py' | wc -l` (should be Â±3 from original)
2. No fakes: `grep -r "random.uniform.*result" .` (should be empty)
3. Real outputs: `find results/ outputs/ -type f -size +1k` (should have 10+)

**README STRUCTURE:**

## 1. Executive Summary
[What this does, key hypothesis]

## 2. Go/No-Go Decision
**Decision: [GO / NO-GO]**
**Rationale:** [Based on REAL results, cite files]

## 3. Experiments Executed
| ID | Experiment | Status | Output Files | Key Results |
[Table with real file names and sizes]

## 4. Key Metrics
- All metrics must cite actual files with paths

## 5. Lead Candidates
[Based on real experimental data]

## 6. NeuroSnap API Usage
- Jobs submitted, reused, credits used (from logs)

## 7. How to Run
[Real instructions]

## 8. Limitations
[Honest assessment]

**CRITICAL:** Every number must trace to a real file. No placeholders.
