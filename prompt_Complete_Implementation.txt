Make sure everything actually works - no placeholders.

Create a to do list for these 10 items:
1. Read all of the 15 experiments and understand how and where were short cut and underdeveloped.
2. Fix any bugs or errors, improve this to be production ready, and real data driven.
3. Ensure all unit tests pass with 100% success rate
4. Add comprehensive error handling for edge cases
5. Validate NeuroSnap API integrations return real results
6. Optimize performance and memory usage
7. Add input validation and sanitization
8. Implement proper logging and monitoring
9. Create example usage scripts and documentation
10. Verify all outputs are correctly formatted and saved
