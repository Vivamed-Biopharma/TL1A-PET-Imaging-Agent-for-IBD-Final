## Robustness & Fallback Mechanisms

### API Resilience
**Problem:** External APIs (Boltz-2, StaB-ddG) may be unavailable or return errors.

**Solutions Implemented:**

1. **Local Results Caching (Experiment 11):**
   - Check `results/neurosnap/` for existing job outputs before API calls
   - Reuse previously downloaded structure predictions
   - Prevents redundant API calls and maintains continuity

2. **Sequence-Based Fallbacks (Experiment 13):**
   - When StaB-ddG API fails, use property-based ddG heuristics
   - Scientifically valid approximations based on amino acid chemistry
   - Maintains pipeline functionality without external dependencies

3. **Job Deduplication:**
   - SHA256 hashing of job parameters
   - Automatic detection and reuse of identical previous jobs
   - Reduces API load and ensures reproducibility
