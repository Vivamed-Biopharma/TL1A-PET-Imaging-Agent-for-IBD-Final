### **Comprehensive Program Dossier: Ga-68‚ÄìNOTA‚ÄìFab TL1A ImmunoPET**

This document provides a complete overview of the program to develop a novel Positron Emission Tomography (PET) imaging agent targeting Tumor Necrosis Factor-like Ligand 1A (TL1A) for applications in Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD).

### **1. The Big Picture: Innovation and Strategic Rationale**

**What is the program?**
We are developing a first-in-class immunoPET tracer, `[Ga-68]-NOTA-Fab-TL1A`, designed to non-invasively visualize and quantify TL1A expression directly in the inflamed gut tissue of IBD patients.

**The Innovation:**
The core innovation is the creation of a precision diagnostic tool that directly measures the activity of a key biological pathway in IBD. The asset is a carefully engineered biologic-device combination:
* **Targeting Moiety:** A de-novo, human-framework antibody fragment (Fab) that binds specifically to TL1A. The Fab format is chosen for its rapid pharmacokinetics, enabling same-day imaging.
* **Chemistry:** A robust and widely used chelation system (NOTA) for stably holding the radioisotope.
* **Conjugation:** A simple, scalable lysine-based conjugation method using a commodity linker (p-SCN-Bn-NOTA).
* **Isotope:** Gallium-68 (Ga-68), a generator-produced positron emitter with a short half-life (68 min) perfectly matched to the Fab's clearance profile, allowing for high-contrast images within hours of injection.

**Why is this strategically important now?**
The biopharmaceutical industry has validated TL1A as a blockbuster target in IBD. This is evidenced by two landmark deals:
1. **Merck's acquisition of Prometheus Biosciences for ~$10.8 billion** for its anti-TL1A antibody, PRA023 (now MK-7240).
2. **Roche's acquisition of Telavant from Roivant for $7.1 billion upfront** for the U.S./Japan rights to its anti-TL1A antibody, RVT-3101.

These deals create an urgent market need for tools that can de-risk the massive investments in TL1A therapeutics. Our tracer is designed to be that tool, serving as a **companion diagnostic** to improve the probability of success for these multi-billion dollar drug programs.

### **2. The Scientific Hypothesis: Disease, Target, and Solution**

#### **The Disease: Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD)**
IBD (Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis) is a chronic inflammatory condition of the gut. A major challenge is patient heterogeneity; different biological pathways drive the disease in different people. This is why many patients fail to respond to existing therapies, including anti-TNFŒ± drugs. There is a critical unmet need for diagnostics that can stratify patients based on the specific molecular drivers of their disease.

#### **The Target: TL1A (TNFSF15)**
TL1A is a cytokine that has emerged as a central driver of inflammation and fibrosis in IBD.
* **Mechanism:** TL1A binds to its receptor, Death Receptor 3 (DR3), on immune cells (like T-helper cells). This interaction promotes the production of pro-inflammatory signals (e.g., IFN-Œ≥, IL-17) and contributes to tissue damage and scarring (fibrosis).
* **Clinical Validation:** TL1A levels are elevated in the gut tissue and blood of IBD patients and correlate with disease severity. Most importantly, therapeutic antibodies that block the TL1A-DR3 interaction have shown profound efficacy in Phase 2 clinical trials, leading to the aforementioned acquisitions.

#### **The Hypothesis & The Solution**
Our central hypothesis is that **by directly imaging TL1A expression in the gut, we can solve two critical problems in IBD drug development and treatment:**

1. **The Patient Selection Problem:** Not all IBD is TL1A-driven. Giving an expensive anti-TL1A drug to a patient with low TL1A expression is unlikely to work.
* **Our Solution (Baseline Enrichment):** A pre-treatment PET scan with our tracer will identify patients with high TL1A expression in their inflamed tissue. These "TL1A-high" patients are the most likely to respond to therapy, allowing for enrichment of clinical trials and, eventually, personalized treatment selection.

2. **The Target Engagement Problem:** After giving a drug, it's difficult to know if it has reached its target in the diseased tissue at a sufficient concentration to have a biological effect.
* **Our Solution (Early Target Engagement):** A PET scan before the first dose establishes a baseline signal. A second scan shortly after the dose will show a **drop in signal** if the therapeutic antibody is occupying the TL1A target, preventing our tracer from binding. This provides rapid, definitive proof of target engagement, enabling faster go/no-go decisions in clinical development.

### **3. The Asset: All Technical Details and Data**

#### **3.2 The Chemistry: Chelator and Linker**

The chemical components are standard, well-characterized, and chosen for manufacturing simplicity and reliability.

* **Chelator (NOTA):** `OC(=O)CN1CCN(CCN(CC(=O)O)CC(=O)O)CC1`
* NOTA forms an exceptionally stable complex with Ga-68, preventing release of the radioisotope in vivo.
* **Lysine-Reactive Linker (p-SCN-Bn-NOTA):** `C1CN(CC(N(CCN1CC(=O)O)CC(=O)O)CC2=CC=C(C=C2)N=C=S)CC(=O)O`
* The isothiocyanate group (`-N=C=S`) reacts with primary amines on lysine side chains to form a stable thiourea bond. This allows for a straightforward, one-step conjugation process under mild aqueous conditions.

### **4. The Development Plan: From In-Silico to In-Vivo Proof-of-Concept**

The program follows a staged, gate-driven plan to systematically de-risk the asset.

#### **Phase A: Computational De-risking (In-Silico)**

This phase uses computational modeling to analyze all 12 clones and prioritize the best candidates for wet-lab synthesis, saving time and resources.

* **Goal:** Identify clones with the best predicted developability, binding potential, and suitability for lysine conjugation.
* **Key Analyses:**
1. **Canonicalization & Germline:** Number all sequences using the IMGT standard and identify the closest human germline genes to ensure "human-ness."
2. **Developability Flags:** Scan for liabilities like aggregation motifs (`NG`, `DG`), oxidation sites (`Met`, `Trp`), and calculate properties like isoelectric point (pI) and hydrophobicity.
3. **Structural Modeling:** Build 3D models of each Fab to visualize the antigen-binding site (paratope) and assess structural integrity.
4. **Conjugation Modeling (Critical Step):** This is a key innovation of the plan.
* **Lysine Accessibility:** Calculate the Solvent Accessible Surface Area (SASA) for every lysine (K) residue in the 3D models.
* **Risk-Weighted Lysine Count:** Define an "accessible lysine" count (`K_accessible`) that down-weights lysines in the binding site (CDRs) to minimize conjugation events that could harm binding affinity: `K_accessible = K_FR + 0.5 √ó K_CDR`.
* **DAR Prediction Model:** Use a binomial probability model to predict the distribution of Drug-to-Antibody Ratios (DAR) for different amounts of linker (`eq`) added in the reaction.
* Per-site modification probability: `p_site(eq) = 1 ‚àí exp(‚àíeff √ó eq / K_accessible)`
* DAR distribution: `P(DAR = k) = C(K_accessible, k) √ó p_site^k √ó (1 ‚àí p_site)^(K_accessible ‚àí k)`
* The model uses a fixed effective coupling efficiency (`eff ‚âà 0.45`) to find the optimal linker amount (`Eq_best`) that maximizes the desired **DAR 1-2** fraction while minimizing high-DAR species (`DAR ‚â• 4`).
5. **Epitope & Cross-Reactivity:** Predict where the Fabs bind on human TL1A (ideally blocking the DR3 interaction site) and assess the likelihood of binding to mouse TL1A to ensure the animal models are relevant.

#### **Phase B: Wet Lab Validation (In-Vitro)**

This phase involves synthesizing the top candidates and confirming their properties at the bench.

* **Gate G1 (Binding/Competition):** Must have **‚â•2 clones** with:
* **Binding Affinity (KD) ‚â§ 10 nM** (measured by SPR/BLI).
* **DR3-Fc Block ‚â• 50%** (confirming the mechanism of action).
* **Gate G2 (Conjugation):** The NOTA-conjugated Fab must have:
* **DAR 1‚Äì2** (measured by mass spectrometry).
* **Immunoreactive Fraction (IRF) ‚â• 70%** (ensuring the conjugate still binds its target well).
* **High Molecular Weight (HMW) species ‚â§ 3%** (ensuring no aggregation).
* **Gate G3 (Labeling QC):** The final Ga-68 labeled product must meet radiopharmaceutical standards:
* **Radiochemical Purity (RCP) ‚â• 95%**.
* **pH 6.8‚Äì7.4**.
* Endotoxin levels within specification.

#### **Phase C: Proof-of-Concept (In-Vivo)**

This phase tests the lead tracer in a disease-relevant animal model.

* **Model:** DSS-induced colitis in mice, which is known to upregulate TL1A.
* **Study Arms:**
1. **Inflamed:** DSS-treated mice receive the tracer.
2. **Blocked:** Inflamed mice are pre-dosed with excess "cold" (non-radioactive) Fab to block the TL1A targets before receiving the tracer.
3. **Healthy Control:** Healthy mice receive the tracer.
* **Gate G4 (In-Vivo Success):** The tracer must demonstrate:
* **Specific Uptake:** A **Tumor-to-Background Ratio (TBR)** of **‚â• 1.5** in the colon of inflamed mice vs. blood or muscle.
* **Blockade:** A **signal drop of ‚â• 50%** in the blocked group compared to the inflamed group, proving the signal is specific to TL1A.

### **5. Intellectual Property and Commercial Strategy**

The program is designed for high commercial appeal and a strong IP position.

**Intellectual Property (from Provisional Patent):**
The IP strategy creates multiple layers of protection:
1. **Composition-of-Matter (CoM) on the Fabs:** Each of the 12 novel VH/VL sequences (SEQ ID NOs: 1-24) is a distinct invention.
2. **CoM on the Conjugate:** The specific combination of an anti-TL1A Fab from our panel covalently linked to a NOTA chelator.
3. **CoM on the Radiopharmaceutical:** The final product, comprising the Fab-NOTA conjugate complexed with Gallium-68.
4. **Method-of-Use:** Claims covering the clinical applications:
* Using the tracer to image TL1A expression.
* Using the tracer to select patients for TL1A therapy.
* Using the tracer to monitor target engagement of a TL1A therapeutic.

**Commercial Strategy:**
The goal is to partner with or be acquired by a pharmaceutical company developing a TL1A therapeutic. The value proposition is clear:
* **De-risks Clinical Trials:** Our tracer can increase the probability of success for a partner's multi-billion dollar drug by ensuring the right patients are enrolled and that the drug is hitting its target.
* **CMC & Operational Simplicity:** The use of a Fab, lysine conjugation, NOTA, and generator-based Ga-68 makes the tracer easy to manufacture, scale, and deploy globally for multi-site clinical trials.
* **High Partnering Appeal:** The outputs of our program (TBR, % block, DAR, KD) map directly to the key questions that drug developers need to answer, making the data package "BD-ready."
