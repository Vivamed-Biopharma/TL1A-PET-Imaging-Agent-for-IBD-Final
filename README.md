## NeuroSnap API Integration

**Status:** ✅ Partially Operational

### Jobs Submitted
- **Boltz-2 (AlphaFold3):** 2 jobs completed successfully
  - Job ID: bc75f94d0209bcf7b4cbeeb185426527ed53a27b437887679cf6f182ec63dbb4
  - Job ID: ed3309e3e625e9827da966e68216d7b1511ec5c04ae460721f1f09206d0bc126
  - Output: 12 MB of CIF files, MSA files, and confidence scores

### Jobs Reused
- Reuse logic implemented via SHA256 note hashing
- Prevents redundant API calls for identical inputs

### API Corrections Applied
✅ Fixed field names:
- ADMET-AI: "Input Molecule" → "Input Molecules" (plural)
- Boltz-2: "Input Sequences" → "Input Molecules"
- StaB-ddG: "Input Molecule" → "Input Structure"
- TemStaPro: "Input PDB" → "Input Structure"

✅ Fixed endpoint:
- `/job/files/{job_id}/out` → `/job/data/{job_id}` (correct)

### Known Issues
- **StaB-ddG:** Returns 400 Bad Request (service may be down/deprecated)
- **AI Confidence Scores:** Several services (eTox, Aggrescan3D, TemStaPro, DeepImmuno) return confidence=0.0, suggesting:
  - Services may require different input formats
  - Jobs may be queued but not completed
  - Service-specific API issues

## Critical Fixes Applied

### 1. Experiment 15 Schema Mismatch ✅ FIXED
**Issue:** Script expected `Thermo_Score` but CSV contained `Combined_Stability_Score`
**Fix:** Updated `scripts/15_decision_scorecard.py` lines 116-117 and 136-137
**Result:** Experiment 15 now runs successfully and produces full scorecard

### 2. Experiment 2 Missing BioTransformer ✅ FIXED
**Issue:** BioTransformer JAR file not available for download
**Fix:** Replaced with RDKit-based SMARTS pattern matching for metabolic site prediction
**Result:** Experiment 2 produces real metabolism predictions (4 sites identified)

### 3. Fake PDB File ✅ FIXED
**Issue:** `data/fab_model.pdb` contained only 9 dummy atoms
**Fix:** Converted Boltz-2 CIF output to PDB (3857 real atoms from AlphaFold3 prediction)
**Result:** Experiments 9 and 12 now analyze real protein structure

### 4. Experiment 12 Interface Detection ✅ FIXED
**Issue:** Interface fingerprinting returned 0 residues (incorrect ProDy API usage)
**Fix:** Implemented manual distance-based interface detection (5Å cutoff)
**Result:** 41 interface residues detected with 34% hydrophobic ratio

### 5. NeuroSnap API Field Names ✅ FIXED
**Issue:** Services expected "Input Molecules" but code used "Input Molecule"
**Fix:** Updated `scripts/neurosnap_client.py` lines 209, 238, 246, 231
**Result:** API calls now use correct field names per service requirements

## Known Limitations

### Experiments Not Run
1. **Experiment 13 (Alanine Scanning):** StaB-ddG API returns 400 error
   - Root cause: Service may be deprecated or require different auth
   - Workaround: Could implement FoldX-based ddG locally
   - Impact: Missing residue-level stability predictions

### AI Confidence Scores at Zero
Several NeuroSnap services return `AI_Confidence: 0.0`:
- eTox (toxicity prediction)
- Aggrescan3D (aggregation)
- TemStaPro (thermostability)
- DeepImmuno (immunogenicity)

**Possible causes:**
- Jobs submitted but still queued
- Services require PDB files instead of sequences
- Service-specific API changes not documented

**Mitigation:** Experiments fall back to sequence-based predictions (which are scientifically valid)

### BioTransformer Unavailable
- Official JAR download links are broken
- Replaced with custom SMARTS-based metabolism prediction
- Trade-off: Less comprehensive than BioTransformer but still scientifically valid
